#Decktet - Magnate

- This project was made in 2012 and it was developed in Java with NetBeans. 
- The project itself is in Portuguese, although all the code and comments are in English.
- The game uses a finite-state machine and the model-view-controller model.
- The game logic is completely separate from its interface, so the game can be played using the console or GUI. 
- The rules of the game can be found [here](http://wiki.decktet.com/game:magnate).
- You can zoom the board game using CTRL + Scroll.
