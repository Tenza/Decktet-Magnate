#Decktet - Magnate

- This project was made in 2012 and it was developed in Java with NetBeans. 
- The project itself is in Portuguese, although all the code and comments are in English.
- The game logic is completely separate from its interface, and the game is available to be played in text or GUI (default).
- The game uses a finite-state machine to control the game flow and model-view-controller to control GUI interaction.
- The rules of the game can be found [here](http://wiki.decktet.com/game:magnate).
- The cards can be selected and reselected using right click.
- The tokens can be selected and deselected using right/left/middle clicks. 
- It is also possible to zoom the board game by pressing CTRL + Scroll.
